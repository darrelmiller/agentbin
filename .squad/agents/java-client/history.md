# Java — History

## 2026-03-21 — Initial onboarding

- Java client was rewritten during SDK upgrade cycle
- Uses local Java SDK source in test-java-sdk/ directory
- SDK not yet published to Maven Central
- Status needs review after prior rewrite

## Learnings

### SDK dependency audit (2026-03-21)
- pom.xml uses groupId `io.github.a2asdk` version `1.0.0.Alpha3` — these are **published Maven Central** artifacts
- The `_remote.repositories` file confirms Alpha3 jars were fetched from `central` (Maven Central)
- Local `.m2` also has `1.0.0.Alpha4-SNAPSHOT` jars (locally installed, no remote origin)
- Upstream SDK at `D:\github\a2aproject\a2a-java` uses groupId `org.a2aproject.sdk` version `1.0.0.Beta1-SNAPSHOT` — **different groupId** from what pom.xml references
- The history note about "uses local Java SDK source in test-java-sdk/" is outdated — pom.xml actually pulls from Maven Central
- Alpha3 is two versions behind upstream (Alpha3 → Alpha4-SNAPSHOT → Beta1-SNAPSHOT)

### Standalone runner (2026-03-21)
- Created `tests/ClientTests/java/run.py` matching Go runner pattern
- Uses separate compile + exec:java steps with `shell=True` on Windows for `mvn.cmd` compatibility
- Produces summary with pass/fail counts from results.json

### ⚠ Cross-Team Alert: JS SDK Breaking Change (2026-03-22)

**Alert from TypeScript agent:** The @a2a-js/sdk dependency (epic/1.0_breaking_changes branch) has removed `JsonRpcTransport` from client exports (commit c29f4f8 "Remove JSON-RPC Client #353"). The JS test client will break when `npm install` is run because it imports `JsonRpcTransport`. Additionally, commit a886b1a switched codebase to proto-based types (may require more import changes). The JSON-RPC transport removal appears intentional (architectural decision in the SDK), so tests should likely be adapted to REST-only rather than pinned. No action needed for Java client — this is informational cross-team awareness.

### SDK upgrade: Alpha3 → Beta1-SNAPSHOT (2026-03-21)
- **Completed upgrade** from `io.github.a2asdk:1.0.0.Alpha3` (Maven Central) to `org.a2aproject.sdk:1.0.0.Beta1-SNAPSHOT` (local build)
- Upstream SDK built from `D:\github\a2aproject\a2a-java` with `mvn clean install -DskipTests -Dinvoker.skip=true` (BOM invoker test fails, skip it)
- **API breaking changes found and fixed:**
  - `cancelTask()` now takes `CancelTaskParams` instead of `TaskIdParams` — CancelTaskParams supports metadata field
  - `subscribeToTask()` requires consumers and error handler as method params (not just on builder)
  - `PushNotificationConfig` class removed — `TaskPushNotificationConfig` is now a 6-param record (id, taskId, url, token, authentication, tenant)
- **Behavioral change:** Beta SDK emits `TaskEvent` at SUBMITTED state (not just terminal). All consumer patterns that resolved CompletableFuture on any TaskEvent needed state checks added.
- **Import paths unchanged:** `io.a2a.*` packages are the same despite groupId change
- **Artifact IDs unchanged:** `a2a-java-sdk-client`, `a2a-java-sdk-client-transport-jsonrpc`, `a2a-java-sdk-client-transport-rest`
- **Test results:** 27/58 pass. JSONRPC transport still broken (protobuf serialization: "Parameter 'id' may not be null"), agent card unmarshalling fails on both transports. These are upstream SDK bugs.
- **Cancel-with-metadata test** now actually sends metadata via CancelTaskParams (was impossible with Alpha3's TaskIdParams)

### SDK upgrade: Alpha4 → Beta1-SNAPSHOT (2026-07-28)
- **Pulled latest** from `D:\github\a2aproject\a2a-java` — 10 new commits since Alpha4 tag
- **Built and installed** with `mvn clean install -DskipTests -Dinvoker.skip=true` (exit 0)
- **Updated pom.xml** from `1.0.0.Alpha4` → `1.0.0.Beta1-SNAPSHOT` — compiles cleanly
- **Key changes in Beta1-SNAPSHOT:**
  - `feat(errors): add structured error codes and details (#743)` — `A2AErrorCodes` is now an enum (was interface), `A2AError.getData()` → `getDetails()` (returns `Map<String, Object>`)
  - `feat: Add HTTP caching headers to Agent Card endpoint (#761)` — server-side only
  - `fix: Keep stream open on interrupted state changes (#756)` — may help streaming tests on INPUT_REQUIRED
  - `feat(http-client): prebuilt HttpClient support (#745)` — convenience, no test impact
  - `TaskState` now has `isInterrupted()` method (INPUT_REQUIRED, AUTH_REQUIRED)
  - Various server-side fixes (terminal state rejection, empty Content-Type, etc.)
- **No breaking changes for our test client:** Our code doesn't reference `getData()`, `A2AErrorCodes`, or any of the renamed APIs
- **Null-id bug status: NOT FIXED**
  - Root cause traced: JSONRPC transport deserializes Task responses through protobuf (`JsonFormat.parser()`) → MapStruct mapper → Task constructor
  - MapStruct `TaskMapper` has `@Mapping(target = "id", qualifiedByName = "emptyToNull")` which converts empty string → null
  - `Task.java` constructor still calls `Assert.checkNotNullParam("id", id)` — throws when id is null
  - The structured error codes commit only changed error *reporting*, not Task deserialization
  - This is an upstream SDK architectural issue (protobuf intermediate layer strips/empties the id field)
  - No commits since Alpha4 touched the Task deserialization path in JSONRPCUtils

### Dashboard corrected known failure annotations (2026-07-25)
- Dashboard corrected ~25 Java `KNOWN_FAILURES` annotations in `tests/run-all.py` to properly attribute `InvalidParamsError: Parameter 'id' may not be null` as a **client-side Java SDK issue** (not server rejection)
- **Root cause identified:** Error string lives in `io.a2a.util.Assert.checkNotNullParam` and fires in the `Task` constructor during response deserialization when protobuf yields null task ID
- **Evidence:** .NET server never produces this message and explicitly allows null JSON-RPC envelope `id` per spec
- **Action item for Java team:** When filing upstream issues against `a2a-java` SDK, reference the client-side `Task` constructor as the failure point, not the server

### SDK upgrade: Package rename to org.a2aproject.sdk (2026-07-29)
- **Pulled 4 new commits** from upstream `a2a-java` origin/main:
  - `5ae111fe` — feat!: Rename root package to org.a2aproject.sdk (#786) — BREAKING CHANGE
  - `6c76a931` — fix: HTTP+JSON transport returns 501 instead of 400 for UnsupportedOperationError (#787)
  - `8f31f874` — fix: return UnsupportedOperationError when subscribing to terminal tasks (#784)
  - `d3f88cb1` — fix: resolve event stream race conditions in EventConsumer and SSE transport (#782)
- **Rebuilt SDK** with `mvn clean install -DskipTests -Dinvoker.skip=true` (~15 min, exit 0)
- **SDK version unchanged:** Still `1.0.0.Beta1-SNAPSHOT` (no version bump in this package rename)
- **Breaking change:** All imports changed from `io.a2a.*` → `org.a2aproject.sdk.*`
- **Fixed all imports in AgentBin:**
  - Java server (4 files): `AgentCardProducer`, `AgentExecutorProducer`, `EchoAgentExecutor`, `SpecAgentExecutor`
  - Java client (1 file): `TestJavaClient.java`
  - All `io.a2a.spec.*`, `io.a2a.client.*`, `io.a2a.server.*` → `org.a2aproject.sdk.spec.*`, etc.
- **pom.xml already correct:** Both server and client were already using groupId `org.a2aproject.sdk` (no pom changes needed)
- **All builds passed:**
  - Java SDK: `mvn clean install` exit 0
  - Java server (`src/AgentBin.Java`): `mvn package -DskipTests` exit 0
  - Java client (`tests/ClientTests/java`): `mvn package -DskipTests` exit 0
- **Test status:** No test run performed (rebuild only per task requirements)
- **Upstream bug fixes in this pull:** UnsupportedOperationError now returns 501 (not 400), subscribing to terminal tasks returns proper error, event stream race conditions fixed
- **Team impact:** This is a coordinated package rename across the entire a2a-java SDK — all Java code in all repos must update imports

### Protobuf version mismatch fix (2026-07-29)
- **Root cause of Java server regression:** The package rename commit (5ae111fe) regenerated protobuf code using protobuf-java 4.33.1 compiler. The generated code calls `RuntimeVersion.validateProtobufGencodeVersion()` which only exists in protobuf-java 4.x. The Quarkus BOM (3.17.7) was pulling in protobuf-java 3.25.5, causing `NoClassDefFoundError: com/google/protobuf/RuntimeVersion$RuntimeDomain` at class initialization time.
- **Symptoms:** All JSON-RPC and REST message handling failed. Agent card endpoint (no protobuf involvement) continued to work. This explains the score drops: .NET 53→15, Go 53→11, Rust 51→10, Swift 30→9 — only discovery/metadata tests still passed.
- **Fix:** Added `protobuf-java` and `protobuf-java-util` version 4.33.1 overrides in `dependencyManagement` section of `pom.xml`, after the Quarkus BOM import. This ensures the SDK's protobuf 4.x generated code runs against the matching runtime.
- **Verification:** Server starts, both JSON-RPC (`SendMessage`) and REST (`/message:send`) endpoints return successful responses.
- **Lesson:** When upgrading a2a-java SDK, always verify the transitive protobuf-java version matches what the SDK was compiled with. Quarkus BOM aggressively manages protobuf versions and can downgrade it.
- **Committed:** 916cd09

### Maven Central migration: Beta1-SNAPSHOT → Beta1 published (2026-04-20)
- **Migrated both pom.xml files** from `1.0.0.Beta1-SNAPSHOT` (local build) to `1.0.0.Beta1` (Maven Central)
- **Version correction:** Task requested `1.0.0.Alpha3` but that version does NOT exist under `org.a2aproject.sdk` on Maven Central. The old Alpha3 was under the previous groupId `io.github.a2asdk`. Available versions: `1.0.0.Alpha4` (2026-03-16) and `1.0.0.Beta1` (2026-04-17).
- **Artifact names unchanged:** All 5 artifacts confirmed on Maven Central at Beta1:
  - Server: `a2a-java-sdk-client`, `a2a-java-sdk-reference-jsonrpc`, `a2a-java-sdk-reference-rest`
  - Client: `a2a-java-sdk-client`, `a2a-java-sdk-client-transport-jsonrpc`, `a2a-java-sdk-client-transport-rest`
- **Both builds verified:** `mvn dependency:resolve -DskipTests` succeeds for both server and client
- **No code changes needed:** Beta1 release matches the Beta1-SNAPSHOT API we were already using
- **Benefit:** No more local SDK builds required for CI/CD — fresh environments can resolve all deps from Maven Central

## Cross-Agent Updates (2026-07-29)

### Published SDK Migration
- a2a-java SDK 1.0.0.Beta1 now available on Maven Central under org.a2aproject.sdk
- Both pom.xml files migrated from 1.0.0.Beta1-SNAPSHOT to 1.0.0.Beta1
- No code changes required — API compatible
- DevContainer created for consistent local development environment
