# DotNet — History

## 2026-03-21 — Initial onboarding

- .NET client uses A2A SDK 1.0.0-preview from NuGet
- 29/58 tests pass (25/27 JSON-RPC, 0/27 REST, 4/4 v0.3)
- All previously-skipped methods (CancelTask, ListTasks, SubscribeToTask, PushConfig) now call real SDK methods
- Cancel tests use streaming pattern to get taskId while task is running
- REST tests all record "SDK does not support" — .NET SDK only has JSON-RPC transport
- IMPORTANT: Must run compiled exe directly, NOT `dotnet run` (kills server process)
- subscribe-to-task fails with "internal error during streaming" — likely server bug

## Learnings

### REST binding enabled via support-rest branch (2026-03-22)

**What changed:**
- The `support-rest` branch in `a2a-dotnet` adds `A2AHttpJsonClient` — a full REST/HTTP+JSON client implementing `IA2AClient`.
- Also adds `A2AClientFactory` (creates client from AgentCard), `A2AClientOptions` (binding preference), `ProtocolBindingNames` constants.
- `A2AHttpJsonClient` uses the same `IA2AClient` interface as `A2AClient` (JSON-RPC), so test code is almost identical — just swap the client constructor.
- Package version bumped from `1.0.0-preview` to `1.0.0-preview2`.

**REST client API surface:**
- Constructor: `new A2AHttpJsonClient(new Uri(baseUrl), httpClient)` — baseUrl is the agent's REST base (e.g., `http://localhost:5555/spec`)
- REST routes: `/message:send`, `/message:stream`, `/tasks/{id}`, `/tasks/{id}:cancel`, `/tasks/{id}:subscribe`, `/tasks`, `/card`, `/extendedAgentCard`, `/tasks/{id}/pushNotificationConfigs/*`
- Streaming uses SSE (`text/event-stream`), same `IAsyncEnumerable<StreamResponse>` as JSON-RPC
- Agent card fetch: REST has `/card` endpoint (different from JSON-RPC `/.well-known/agent-card.json`) — used raw HTTP for card tests
- Cancel: REST `POST /tasks/{id}:cancel` sends empty body — cannot carry metadata (unlike JSON-RPC `CancelTaskRequest.Metadata`)

**Test results:** 53/58 pass (25/27 JSON-RPC, 25/27 REST, 4/4 v0.3)
- REST went from 0/27 → 25/27
- 5 failures are all server-side bugs (not SDK issues):
  - `spec-return-immediately` (both bindings): `Blocking=false` config not implemented server-side
  - `subscribe-to-task` (JSON-RPC): "internal error during streaming"
  - `subscribe-to-task` (REST): timeout — no events received
  - `error-subscribe-not-found` (REST): returns empty SSE stream instead of error

**Infrastructure:**
- `nuget.config` (root + test client) now includes `./nupkgs` as local feed
- Server + client both reference `A2A 1.0.0-preview2` / `A2A.AspNetCore 1.0.0-preview2`
- NuGet cache must be cleared when switching package versions: `dotnet nuget locals all --clear`

### a2a-dotnet versioning pipeline investigation (2026-03-21)

**Version control files:**
- `src/Directory.Build.props` — THE source of truth for package version. Currently `<Version>1.0.0-preview2</Version>`. Controls both NuGet package version and assembly InformationalVersion.
- `A2A.csproj` — has `<PackageId>A2A</PackageId>` but NO version properties (inherits from Directory.Build.props).
- Root `Directory.Build.props` — no version properties, just compiler settings and strong-naming.
- No `version.props` or other version files exist.

**CI pipeline (release.yaml):**
- For release events: `dotnet pack --configuration Release` with NO version override — version comes entirely from `src/Directory.Build.props`.
- For daily/manual: `dotnet pack --version-suffix "ci.{run_number}"` — produces CI preview packages.
- NuGet.org publish only triggers on GitHub Release events from the `a2aproject/a2a-dotnet` repo.

**Root cause of the observed version mismatch (NuGet `1.0.0-preview` vs DLL `1.0.0-preview2`):**
- The A2A package in the local NuGet cache (`~/.nuget/packages/a2a/1.0.0-preview/`) was NOT restored from NuGet.org. The `.nupkg.metadata` file shows `"source": "D:\\github\\darrelmiller\\agentbin\\nupkgs"`.
- The locally-built `A2A.1.0.0-preview.nupkg` exists at `D:\github\a2aproject\a2a-dotnet\nupkgs`, timestamped March 17 — AFTER the version was bumped to `1.0.0-preview2` in commit `2a7d7b3`.
- The DLLs inside were compiled from source at `1.0.0-preview2` (commit `2a7d7b3`), but the NuGet package version was overridden to `1.0.0-preview` at pack time (likely via `-p:PackageVersion` or `--version-suffix`).
- This is NOT a CI pipeline bug — the actual NuGet.org release (workflow run #257, tag `v1.0.0-preview1`) was built from commit `0664792b` where `<Version>1.0.0-preview</Version>` was correct and consistent.

**Fix:** Clear the NuGet cache (`dotnet nuget locals all --clear`) and restore to get the genuine NuGet.org package. Ensure `nuget.config` doesn't include local `nupkgs/` as a source.

**Minor pipeline concern:** The GitHub release tag `v1.0.0-preview1` doesn't match the source version `1.0.0-preview` — the tag has a trailing "1" that the package does not. This is a naming inconsistency in the release process, not a functional bug.

### Standalone test runner created (2026-07-25)

- Created `tests/ClientTests/dotnet/run.py` — standalone runner that builds with `dotnet build` then runs the compiled exe directly (per charter: never `dotnet run`).
- Usage: `python run.py [base_url]` — default base URL is the Azure Container Apps endpoint.
- Produces `results.json` in the same directory and prints pass/fail summary.
- `run-all.py` still uses `["dotnet", "run", "--"]` (line 89) — should be updated to match.

### SDK dependency audit (2026-07-25)

- **.csproj references:** `A2A 1.0.0-preview` (no A2A.AspNetCore — not needed for client tests).
- **NuGet source:** `nuget.config` points only to `nuget.org` — using published NuGet, NOT local nupkgs.
- **Latest published on NuGet.org:** `1.0.0-preview` — matches .csproj. Up to date with published.
- **Local nupkgs/ folder:** Contains `A2A.1.0.0-alpha.nupkg` and `A2A.AspNetCore.1.0.0-alpha.nupkg` — very stale (alpha vs preview), dated March 13. These are NOT being consumed.
- **Local SDK repo (`a2a-dotnet`):** `src/Directory.Build.props` has `<Version>1.0.0-preview2</Version>`. A `dotnet pack` would produce `1.0.0-preview2` — newer than what's on NuGet.org.
- **Gap:** NuGet.org has `1.0.0-preview`, local repo would produce `1.0.0-preview2`. The `1.0.0-preview2` release has not been published to NuGet.org yet.

### ⚠ Cross-Team Alert: JS SDK Breaking Change (2026-03-22)

**Alert from TypeScript agent:** The @a2a-js/sdk dependency (epic/1.0_breaking_changes branch) has removed `JsonRpcTransport` from client exports (commit c29f4f8 "Remove JSON-RPC Client #353"). The JS test client will break when `npm install` is run because it imports `JsonRpcTransport`. Additionally, commit a886b1a switched codebase to proto-based types (may require more import changes). The JSON-RPC transport removal appears intentional (architectural decision in the SDK), so tests should likely be adapted to REST-only rather than pinned. No action needed for DotNet client — this is informational cross-team awareness.

### Reverted to published A2A 1.0.0-preview NuGet packages (2026-07-25)

**What changed:**
- Both `AgentBin.csproj` and `A2AClientTests.csproj` reverted from `A2A 1.0.0-preview2` → `A2A 1.0.0-preview`
- `A2A.AspNetCore` also reverted from `1.0.0-preview2` → `1.0.0-preview`
- REST tests in Program.cs reverted to "sdk-does-not-support" stubs (27 tests)
- NuGet cache cleared to ensure genuine NuGet.org packages

**Build results:**
- **Server (`AgentBin`):** Builds and runs successfully with `A2A.AspNetCore 1.0.0-preview`
- **Client (`A2AClientTests`):** Builds successfully after stubbing REST tests — `A2AHttpJsonClient` does NOT exist in `A2A 1.0.0-preview`

**KEY FINDING — REST endpoint availability:**
- `A2A.AspNetCore 1.0.0-preview` does **NOT** serve REST/HTTP+JSON endpoints
- `GET /spec/card` → 404, `POST /spec/message:send` → 404, `GET /spec/tasks` → 404
- JSON-RPC works fine: `GET /spec/.well-known/agent-card.json` → 200
- **Conclusion:** REST transport (both client `A2AHttpJsonClient` and server-side REST routing) is a `1.0.0-preview2` feature that has NOT been published to NuGet.org

**Test results:** 29/58 pass (25/27 JSON-RPC, 0/27 REST stubbed, 4/4 v0.3)
- JSON-RPC failures: `spec-return-immediately` (Blocking=false not implemented server-side), `subscribe-to-task` (internal error during streaming)
- REST failures: all 27 stubbed as "sdk-does-not-support"
- v0.3: all 4 pass
